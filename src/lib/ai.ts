    content: `I'm here to help you master calculus! Let me break this down systematically:

## üéØ Problem Analysis
First, let's identify what type of calculus problem you're working with:
- **Derivatives**: Finding rates of change
- **Integrals**: Finding areas or antiderivatives  
- **Limits**: Understanding behavior as values approach a point

## üìö Key Concepts & Formulas

### Derivatives
- Power Rule: d/dx[x‚Åø] = nx‚Åø‚Åª¬π
- Product Rule: d/dx[f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)
- Chain Rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) ¬∑ g'(x)

### Integrals
- Power Rule: ‚à´x‚Åødx = x‚Åø‚Å∫¬π/(n+1) + C
- Integration by Parts: ‚à´u dv = uv - ‚à´v du
- Substitution: Let u = g(x), then ‚à´f(g(x))g'(x)dx = ‚à´f(u)du

## üîç Step-by-Step Approach
1. **Identify the problem type and applicable rules**
2. **Set up the problem with proper notation**
3. **Apply the appropriate technique step by step**
4. **Simplify and check your work**
5. **Verify your answer makes sense**

**Quick Example**: ‚à´2x dx = 2‚à´x dx = 2(x¬≤/2) + C = x¬≤ + C

    content: `Let me help you with this physics problem:

## Step 1: Draw a Free Body Diagram
- Identify all forces acting on the object
- Label forces with their magnitudes and directions
- Choose a coordinate system

## Step 2: Apply Newton's Laws
- Œ£F = ma (Newton's second law)
- Break forces into components if needed
- Solve for unknowns

## Step 3: Check Units and Reasonableness
- Ensure your answer has correct units
- Verify the magnitude makes sense

**Example**: For a block on an inclined plane, the forces are:
- Weight (mg) downward
- Normal force (N) perpendicular to surface
- Friction (f) parallel to surface

  'coding': {
    content: `Here's how to approach this coding problem:

## Step 1: Understand the Problem
- Read the problem statement carefully
- Identify inputs, outputs, and constraints
- Consider edge cases

## Step 2: Plan Your Approach
- Choose appropriate data structures
- Think about time and space complexity
- Consider different algorithms

## Step 3: Write Pseudocode
- Break down the solution into steps
- Handle edge cases explicitly
- Test your logic mentally

## Step 4: Implement and Test
- Write clean, readable code
- Test with sample inputs
- Debug any issues

**Example**: For finding the maximum element in an array:
\`\`\`javascript
function findMax(arr) {
  if (arr.length === 0) return null;
  let max = arr[0];
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] > max) max = arr[i];
  }
  return max;
}
